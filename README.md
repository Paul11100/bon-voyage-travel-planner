## INSPIRATION

With the entire event of the pandemic on the world and the annual summer break coming soon, everyone's excited to sit back and relax, probably even go places for sightseeing. Whichever it is, Pykic Adventure is ready to help. With just three clicks on our website which allows you to choose an origin and a destination, you get a detailed map ready to journey you far, far away to your desired centre using the best route that's fastest, easiest and shortest.

## WHAT IT DOES

As simple and quick as your Google Maps is, we've integrated Pykic for any user around the globe to select starting and finishing points for their vacation of any kind with the best user experience.

Our project automatically generates a suitable map for the journey — either by cycling, hiking or driving to their destination.

## FUTURE UPGRADES

We hope to include a drop-down menu for allowing our users to choose their desired days for taking off. Through this, our project would present them with multiple time options they can choose to go during that particular day(s) with a detailed analysis of how traffic would affect their journey, time estimate and cost(s) of the journey.
